        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img class="profile" src="assets/images/" style="height: 150px; width: 150px">
        <p>I was born in Charlotte, North Carolina and when I was 23 I moved to North Dakota for a construction job. I then moved to Boulder, Colorado for a different job and that is where I met my fianc√©. We moved back to Charlotte in 2017 to be closer to our families; as we were expecting a daughter of our own. Since moving back, our daughter was born, and I decided to follow my passion in web/software development and coding. </p>
        <p>I am currently attending the coding boot camp at UNCC and am projected to finish the program in December 2018. </p>
        <p>I am enjoying furthering my knowledge in the IT world and hope to continue to do so upon completion.</p>
